This repository stores various OpenCL kernels in different optimized and unoptimized variants. Usually I use one file for a kernel and all its variants. This way it can easily be loaded into the [APP Kernel Analyzer](http://developer.amd.com/tools/AMDAPPKernelAnalyzer/Pages/default.aspx). An alternative to that is the [pyclKernelAnalyzer](https://github.com/theMarix/pyclKernelAnalyzer) which also works on Linux, analyzes all kernels in a file in one compile and has an easier to use command line interface.
